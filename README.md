# Bellegarda_ReissnerFiber_oscillations

test_fiber_track_final.m is the final script used to estimate the oscillatory acivity of the Reissner fiber (RF) over the dorsoventral axis in the central canal of the spinal cord. This script requires the functions fiber_track.m, read_sequence.m and mview2.m to run. The input of test_fiber_track_final.m is an image sequence with the RF in view, and it will output the change in dorsoventral displacement of the RF over the movie and a PCA analysis of the primary components that best explain the variability in the movie.
